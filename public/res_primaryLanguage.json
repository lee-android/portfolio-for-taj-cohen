      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Taj Cohen, a front-end email developer who specializes in responsive HTML and CSS for email. I've been coding since I was a kid tweaking my MySpace layout, but today I build modern, accessible, and high-performing email campaigns for real brands that reach real inboxes. I'm experienced in turning Figma files and creative direction into clean, production-ready code that renders perfectly across email clients. I've worked across multiple platforms, including Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and have used AMPscript to drive personalization at scale. My QA process includes cross-client testing with Litmus, accessibility checks, dark mode previews, and mobile optimization. Beyond the code, I bring a strong understanding of marketing strategy and brand voice, I know how to write an email that looks great and gets results. With a background in both design and advertising, I love collaborating with creative teams to build out campaigns that are beautiful, functional, and on-message. Whether it's newsletters, promos, transactional emails, or dynamic journeys, I'm passionate about crafting experiences that land right, visually and technically.",

        "description": "PROFESSIONAL PROJECT - This was a seasonal campaign I built for ExxonMobil Rewards+ during my time at Rapp. It was a Cinco de Mayo email designed to tease an upcoming offer and drive engagement. I hand-coded the email using responsive HTML and inline CSS, working from Figma files provided by the design team. I ensured the layout was pixel-perfect and consistent across major email clients through Litmus testing. I also handled link validation, accessibility checks, and made sure all tracking parameters were in place. The goal was to drive users to the station locator ahead of the promo window, so I worked closely with our deployment team to make sure timing, offer logic, and CTA alignment were all on point.",
