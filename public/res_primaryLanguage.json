      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Taj Cohen and I am an email developer, specializing in HTML & CSS. I have been coding since I was a young pre-teen, editing my MySpace page to be the coolest and most creative in all my class. Little did I know then, that I was utilizing a skill that would one day bring me joy and fulfillment. I love advertising, and the older that I get, the less weird I feel about it. This country runs on ads, thus marketing has a very special place in my heart and soul. For this reason, I've chosen email development as my career of choice, and I retain the practice and discipline needed to squeeze my foot through the door of this industry with confidence and flair! Due to my secondary love for design, and my artistic background, I specifically have a passion for collaborating with companies and creatives to deliver an optimal responsive email experience to inboxes all over the world by discussing, developing, testing, and launching great projects.",
