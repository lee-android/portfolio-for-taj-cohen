      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Taj Cohen, an email developer who specializes in HTML and CSS. I've been coding since I was a kid, customizing my MySpace page to stand out as the most creative in my classâ€”without even realizing I was laying the groundwork for a future career. I've always loved advertising, and as I've gotten older, I've stopped feeling weird about that. Marketing drives everything in this country, and that makes email development feel like the perfect place to land. With a background in art and a natural eye for design, I enjoy collaborating with companies and creatives to build clean, responsive, accessible emails that actually perform. Whether I'm discussing a layout, troubleshooting rendering issues, or running QA, I take pride in building emails that work everywhere and look great doing it.",
